### Images description

3D images taken with x10 objective on a spinning-disk microscope.

3 channels:
  1. DAPI nuclei (not used)
  2. GFP protrusions
  3. Brightfield patches

### Macro description

* Ask the user to rotate the image so the patches are pointing to the right
* Detect patches in the 3rd channel using Multi-Template-Matching
* Segment protrusions in 2nd channel
* For each detected patch:
     * Crop the protrusions binary mask around it, filter out small objects, and clear the interior of the patch
     * Run skeletonization + geodesic distance map + local thickness from the resulting mask
     * For each protrusion (= skeleton), compute the following: nearest corner of the patch, maximum distance from the patch, direction of the centroid, and mean thickness

 #### Patch corners positioning
